## Hate Speech Detection with Machine Learning

This project aims to combat hate speech online by developing a robust machine learning model for text classification. It leverages the power of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to analyze text data and accurately identify instances of hate speech, offensive language, and neutral content.

### Key Features:

* **Multi-class Classification:** Distinguishes between three categories: hate speech, offensive language, and neutral content.
* **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Ensures data quality and prepares text for model training.
* **Feature Engineering with CountVectorizer:** Converts textual data into numerical features for machine learning.
* **SVM Model Training and Evaluation:** Trains the model on labeled data and assesses its performance using various metrics.
* **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Analyzes the model's accuracy, precision, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
* **Visualization:** Provides insights into model performance through a visual confusion matrix heatmap.

### Benefits:

* **Empowers Social Platforms:** Helps social media platforms identify and moderate hate speech effectively.
* **Protects Users:** Contributes to a safer and more inclusive online environment.
* **Enhances Research:** Provides a foundation for further research on hate speech detection techniques.

### Usage:

* **Prerequisites:** Python 3.x, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.
* **Data:** Requires a labeled dataset containing text and corresponding labels (e.g., hate speech, offensive, neutral).
* **Instructions:**
    1. Replace `"data.csv"` with your dataset path.
    2. Adjust the `clean` function for your specific data cleaning needs.
    3. Run the script to train, evaluate, and visualize the model's performance.

### Future Improvements:

* Explore different machine learning algorithms (e.g., Deep Learning).
* Incorporate sentiment analysis for more nuanced classification.
* Develop a real-time application for online hate speech detection.
